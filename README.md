# nRPC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rapidloop/nrpc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rapidloop/nrpc)

nRPC is an RPC framework like [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), but for
[NATS](https://nats.io/).

It can generate a Go client and server from the same .proto file that you'd
use to generate gRPC clients and servers. The server is generated as a NATS
[MsgHandler](https://godoc.org/github.com/nats-io/go-nats#MsgHandler).

## Why NATS?

Doing RPC over NATS'
[request-response model](http://nats.io/documentation/concepts/nats-req-rep/)
has some advantages over a gRPC model:

- **Minimal service discovery**: The clients and servers only need to know the
  endpoints of a NATS cluster. The clients do not need to discover the
  endpoints of individual services they depend on.
- **Load balancing without load balancers**: Stateless microservices can be
  hosted redundantly and connected to the same NATS cluster. The incoming
  requests can then be random-routed among these using NATS
  [queueing](http://nats.io/documentation/concepts/nats-queueing/). There is
  no need to setup a (high availability) load balancer per microservice.

The lunch is not always free, however. At scale, the NATS cluster itself can
become a bottleneck. Features of gRPC like streaming and advanced auth are not
available.

Still, NATS - and nRPC - offer much lower operational complexity if your
scale and requirements fit.

At RapidLoop, we use this model for our [OpsDash](https://www.opsdash.com)
SaaS product in production and are quite happy with it. nRPC is the third
iteration of an internal library.

## Overview

nRPC comes with a protobuf compiler plugin `protoc-gen-nrpc`, which generates
Go code from a .proto file.

Given a .proto file like [helloworld.proto](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/helloworld/helloworld/helloworld.proto), the usage is like this:

```
$ ls
helloworld.proto
$ protoc --go_out=. --nrpc_out=. helloworld.proto
$ ls
helloworld.nrpc.go	helloworld.pb.go	helloworld.proto
```

The .pb.go file, which contains the definitions for the message classes, is
generated by the standard Go plugin for protoc. The .nrpc.go file, which
contains the definitions for a client, a server interface, and a NATS handler
is generated by the nRPC plugin.

Have a look at the generated and example files:

- the service definition [helloworld.proto](https://github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/tree/master/examples/helloworld/helloworld/helloworld.proto)
- the generated nrpc go file [helloworld.nrpc.go](https://github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/tree/master/examples/helloworld/helloworld/helloworld.nrpc.go)
- an example server [greeter_server/main.go](https://github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/tree/master/examples/helloworld/greeter_server/main.go)
- an example client [greeter_client/main.go](https://github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/tree/master/examples/helloworld/greeter_client/main.go)

## Features

The following wiki pages describe nRPC features in more detail:

- [Load Balancing](https://github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/wiki/Load-Balancing)
- [Metrics Instrumentation](https://github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/wiki/Metrics-Instrumentation)
  using Prometheus

## Installation

nRPC needs Go 1.7 or higher. $GOPATH/bin needs to be in $PATH for the protoc
invocation to work. To generate code, you need the protobuf compiler (which
you can install from [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases))
and the nRPC protoc plugin.

To install the nRPC protoc plugin:

```
$ go get github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/protoc-gen-nrpc
```

To build and run the example greeter_server:

```
$ go get github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/examples/greeter_server
$ greeter_server
server is running, ^C quits.
```

To build and run the example greeter_client:

```
$ go get github.com/rapidloop/nrpc/examples/greeter_client
$ greeter_client
Greeting: Hello world
$
```

## Documentation

To learn more about describing gRPC services using .proto files, see [here](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html).
To learn more about NATS, start with their [website](https://nats.io/). To
learn more about nRPC, um, read the source code.

## Status

nRPC is in alpha. This means that it will work, but APIs may change without
notice.

Currently there is support only for Go clients and servers.
